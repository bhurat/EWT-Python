#The Empirical Wavelet Transform for Python
### By Basile Hurat

##Introduction
This is documentation for the empirical wavelet transform package in Python. Empirical wavelets are a generalization of wavelets. A family of empirical wavelets can be formed from the translation, scaling, and modulation of a mother wavelet. This allows them to be more adaptive than traditional wavelets, and algorithms have been used to construct a family of wavelets that are based on the information of the signal they decompose. The following papers go into more detail on empirical wavelets:
